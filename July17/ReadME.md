# Deleting Nodes from Binary Tree

This Go code snippet provides functionality to delete nodes from a binary tree based on specified values.

## Overview

The function `delNodes` takes a root node of a binary tree and an array `to_delete` containing node values to delete. It returns a list of root nodes of all remaining subtrees after deletion.

## Implementation Details

### TreeNode Struct

The `TreeNode` struct represents a node in the binary tree:
- `Val`: Integer value stored in the node.
- `Left`: Pointer to the left child node.
- `Right`: Pointer to the right child node.

### delNodes Function

#### Parameters

- `root`: The root node of the binary tree.
- `to_delete`: An array of integers representing node values to delete.

#### Variables

- `ret`: A slice to store root nodes of remaining subtrees.
- `r`: A pointer to a potential remaining root node after deletion.

#### Steps

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Uses a recursive DFS approach (`dfs` function) to traverse the binary tree.
2. **Node Deletion**: Checks if the current node's value is in `to_delete`.
   - If yes, adds its children (if not nil) to `roots` and returns without adding the current node to `roots`.
   - If no, adds the current node to `roots`.
3. **Return**: Returns the list of root nodes of all remaining subtrees after deletion.

### dfs Function

The `dfs` function recursively traverses the binary tree:
- Checks if the current node is `nil`. If yes, returns an empty slice and `nil`.
- Recursively calls `dfs` on left and right children.
- Updates the current node's left and right pointers based on recursive calls.
- Returns a slice of remaining root nodes and a potential remaining root node.

### findValue Function

The `findValue` function checks if a given node value exists in `to_delete`.

## Considerations

- Ensure the binary tree `root` is correctly constructed with valid nodes and relationships.
- The function assumes that the nodes to delete exist in the binary tree.
- Performance considerations include time complexity relative to the number of nodes in the binary tree due to recursive traversal and deletion.
