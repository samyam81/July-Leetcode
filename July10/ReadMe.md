# Crawler Log: July 10

The `minOperations` function calculates the minimum operations required to determine the final depth of a file path after processing a series of navigation logs.

## Function Description

The function `minOperations(logs []string) int` takes a slice of strings `logs` where each string represents a navigation command. It computes the final depth of the current directory after executing all the commands in `logs`.

### Navigation Commands:

- `"../"`: Move up to the parent directory. If already at the root, this command has no effect.
- `"./"`: Stay in the current directory. This command has no effect on the depth.
- Any other string: Represents entering a new directory. This increases the depth by 1.

### Parameters:

- `logs`: A slice of strings where each string is a navigation command.

### Return Value:

- An integer representing the final depth of the current directory after executing all the commands in `logs`.

## Usage

You can use this function in your Go program to determine directory depths based on navigation commands provided in the `logs` array.
