# Binary Tree Node Directions

This Go code snippet provides functionality to find directions (path) from a starting node to a destination node in a binary tree.

## Overview

The function `getDirections` takes a binary tree `root`, a starting node value `startValue`, and a destination node value `destValue` as inputs. It returns a string representing the directions (path) from `startValue` to `destValue` in the binary tree.

## Implementation Details

### TreeNode Struct

The `TreeNode` struct represents a node in the binary tree:
- `Val`: Integer value stored in the node.
- `Left`: Pointer to the left child node.
- `Right`: Pointer to the right child node.

### getDirections Function

#### Parameters

- `root`: The root node of the binary tree.
- `startValue`: The value of the starting node.
- `destValue`: The value of the destination node.

#### Variables

- `s`: Directions from `root` to `startValue`.
- `t`: Directions from `root` to `destValue`.

#### Steps

1. **Find Directions**: Uses the `find` function to recursively find the path from `root` to `startValue` and `destValue`.
2. **Compare Paths**: Compares the paths `s` and `t` to find the common prefix.
3. **Construct Result**: Constructs the result string by appending directions from the end of `s` to `t`.

#### Return Value

- Returns a string representing the directions (path) from `startValue` to `destValue` in the binary tree.

### find Function

The `find` function recursively searches for a node with a specified value in the binary tree and returns the path (directions) to that node.

## Considerations

- Ensure the binary tree `root` is correctly constructed with valid nodes and relationships.
- The function assumes that both `startValue` and `destValue` exist in the binary tree.
- Performance considerations include time complexity relative to the depth of the binary tree due to recursive path finding.
